# Creating a Clear Worksheet Button as well as Run Analysis one
1. Create a button to run the ClearWorksheet() macro. (Hint: Try selecting the button we’ve already created, copying it, and then pasting it.)
Create a button on the DQ worksheet to run the DQAnalysis() macro. This part was complete all the information wasa clear then another button was added to bring back the analysis for each sheet
2. Answer this question: What happens if you create a button to run ClearWorksheet() on the DQ worksheet? If you create ClearWorksheet you also will need to create another button to assign the macro relate to the analysis to display the information again.
3. Create a button to run ClearWorksheet() on the DQ worksheet. Does its behavior match what you thought would happen? it just clear the worksheet so I was expecting that to happen. I create ClearWorksheet for DQ Analysis, All Stocks Analysis and Skill Drill Checkerboard

1. Create a nested for loop that puts a 1 into the cells of all columns A through J, and rows 1 through 10 (e.g., cells A1 - A10, B1 - B10, and so forth).

2. Modify the nested for loop to fill in a variable number of cells and rows (Hint: use variables).

3. Modify the nested for loop again to put the sum of the row number and column number into each cell.

4. Finally, using the same looping mechanism, find a method (through Stack Overflow or another site discussed previously) used to clear the content of the cells you have been editing in the previous steps.
